📊 Netflix Content Analysis & Insights
📌 Project Description

This project performs an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset to uncover meaningful trends in content production, distribution, and classification.
Using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques, the project transforms raw, messy data into actionable insights about content growth, genres, countries, ratings, and temporal patterns.

The focus is on real-world data handling, feature engineering, and story-driven visualizations—similar to what a data analyst would do in an industry setting.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and transform raw Netflix data for analysis

Understand how Netflix content has evolved over time

Explore genre distribution and multi-value text columns

Analyze geographic trends and maturity ratings

Engineer new features to extract deeper insights

Visualize findings using clear and insightful charts

🧠 Core Concepts Covered

1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation

Handling missing and inconsistent values

Converting data types (especially date-related fields)

Standardizing text columns for analysis

2️⃣ Time-Series Analysis

Studying how Netflix content has grown year-by-year

Identifying spikes and patterns in content releases

Analyzing trends in Movies vs TV Shows over time

3️⃣ Text Data Manipulation

Parsing multi-value columns such as:

listed_in (genres)

cast

Exploding and reshaping text data for deeper analysis

Identifying the most frequent genres and actors

4️⃣ Geographical & Rating Analysis

Exploring content distribution by country

Comparing maturity ratings (TV-MA, PG-13, etc.)

Understanding regional content strategies

5️⃣ Feature Engineering

Creating new features like:

Content Age (years since release)

Content type indicators

Enhancing analytical depth beyond raw columns

6️⃣ Advanced Visualization

Distribution plots and bar charts

Time-series visualizations

Genre and country-wise comparisons

Insight-driven plots using Matplotlib & Seaborn

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas & NumPy – Data cleaning and manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis

📈 Key Insights

Netflix’s content library has grown rapidly in recent years

Movies dominate the platform, but TV Shows show steady growth

Certain genres and countries contribute disproportionately

Mature content (TV-MA) forms a significant share of the catalog
